    "bio": "Growing up, my father was a programmer, and I was always fascinated by what my father did. As I grew up, that fascination turned into interest. Then that turned into motivation, then into drive, and now I'd love nothing more than to program as a living. \n\n Since then, I have become a goal-oriented, performance-focused, and innovative professional hungry to jump into the field and show the world what I'm capable of!"
